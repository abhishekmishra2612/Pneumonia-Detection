# Pneumonia-Detection using chest X-Ray image
The business objective of this project is to dectect PNEUMONIA from chest X-Ray of a person.
To build this project i used InceptionV3(Transfer Learning) for feature extraction and apply fully connected layers network to get final output(Probability score of having PNEUMONIA)
The output(probability score) gives the possibility of a person having PNEUMONIA .
The dataset i got from kaggle.com
